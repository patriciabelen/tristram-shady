<p class="c4 c14"><span class="c1">In</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the same village where my <span class="show-word">father</span> and my <span class="show-word">mother</span> </span><span class="c1 c7">dwelt, dwelt also</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a thin, upright, <span class="show-word">mother</span>ly, notable, good old body of a midwife, who with the help of a little plain good sense, and some years full employment in her business, in which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts, and a great deal to those of dame Nature,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>had acquired, in her way, no small degree of reputation in the world:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>by which word&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">world</span><span class="c1">, need I in this place inform your worship, that I <span class="show-word">would</span> be understood to mean no more of it, than a small circle described <span class="show-word">upon</span> the circle of the great world, of four&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">English</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;miles diameter, or thereabouts, of which the cottage where the good old woman lived, is supposed to be the centre?<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>She had been left, it seems, a&nbsp;widow in great distress, with three or four small children, in her forty-seventh year; and as she was at that time a person of decent carriage,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>grave deportment,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>a&nbsp;woman moreover of few words, and withal an object of compassion, whose distress, and silence under it, called out the louder for a friendly lift: the wife of the parson of the parish was touched with pity; and having often lamented an inconvenience, to which her husband&rsquo;s flock had for many years been exposed, inasmuch as there was no such thing as a midwife, of any kind or degree, to be got at, let the case have been never so urgent, within less than six or seven long miles riding; which seven said long miles in </span><span class="c1 c7">dark nights and dismal roads</span><span class="c1">, the country thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay, was almost equal to fourteen; and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all; it came into her head, that it <span class="show-word">would</span> be doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole parish, as to the poor creature herself, to get her a little instructed in some of the plain principles of the business, in order to set her up in it. As </span><span class="c1 c7">no woman thereabouts was better</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;qualified to execute the plan she had formed than herself, the gentlewoman very charitably undertook it; and having great influence over the female part of the parish, she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes. In truth, the parson join&rsquo;d his interest with his wife&rsquo;s in the whole affair; and&nbsp;10in order to do things as they should be, and give the poor soul as good a title by law to practise, as his wife had given by institution,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he chearfully paid the fees for the ordinary&rsquo;s licence himself, amounting in the whole, to the sum of eighteen shillings and four pence; so that betwixt them both, the good woman was fully invested in the real and corporal possession of her office, together with all its&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">rights, members, and appurtenances whatsoever</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">These last words, you must know, were not according to the old form in which such licences, faculties, and powers usually ran, which in like cases had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood.

s&aelig;culi</span><span class="c0">, as with the advantage of a death&rsquo;s-head before him;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that, in all other exercitations, he could spend his time, as he rode slowly along,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>to as much account as in his study;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that he could draw up an argument in his sermon,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or a hole in his breeches, as steadily on the<span class="show-word"> one </span>as in the other;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that brisk&nbsp;16trotting and slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible movements.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>But that <span class="show-word">upon</span> his steed<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he could unite and reconcile every thing,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he could compose his sermon<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he could compose his cough,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and, in case nature gave a call that way, he could likewise compose himself to sleep.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>In short, the parson <span class="show-word">upon</span> such encounters <span class="show-word">would</span> assign any cause but the true cause,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and he with-held the true one, only out of a nicety of temper, because he thought it did honour to him.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c9">But the truth of the story was as follows:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;In the first years of this gentleman&rsquo;s life, and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were purchased by him, it had been his m<span class="show-word">Anne</span>r, or vanity, or call it what you will,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>to run into the opposite extreme.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>In the language of the county where he dwelt, he was said to have loved a good horse, and generally had<span class="show-word"> one </span>of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling; and as the nearest midwife, </span><span class="c1 c9">as I told you</span><span class="c0">, did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much as he loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally this, that his horse was either clapp&rsquo;d, or spavin&rsquo;d, or greaz&rsquo;d;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or he was twitter-bon&rsquo;d, or broken-winded, or something, in short, or other had befallen him, which <span class="show-word">would</span> let him carry no flesh;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and a good horse to purchase in his stead.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What the loss on such a balance might amount to,&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">communibus annis</span><span class="c0">, I&nbsp;<span class="show-word">would</span> leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick, to determine;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but let it be what it <span class="show-word">would</span>, the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and <span class="show-word">upon</span> weighing the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he could do ten times as much good;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his charity into<span class="show-word"> one </span>particular ch<span class="show-word">Anne</span>l, and where, as he fancied, it was the least&nbsp;17wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his parish; reserving nothing for the impotent,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nothing for the aged,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where poverty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt together.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed <span class="show-word">upon</span> any application whatever,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or else&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c8">be content to ride the last poor devil</span><span class="c1">, such as they had made him, </span><span class="c1 c8">with all his aches and infirmities, to the very end of the chapter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As he dreaded his own constancy in the first<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he very chearfully betook himself to the second; and though he could very well have explained it, as I said, to his honour,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>yet, for that very reason, he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem a&nbsp;panegyrick&nbsp;<span class="show-word">upon</span> himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">La Mancha</span><span class="c0">, whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I&nbsp;love more, and <span class="show-word">would</span> actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of antiquity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c9">But this is not the moral of my story:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>For </span><span class="c1 c8">you must know</span><span class="c0">, that so long as this explanation <span class="show-word">would</span> have done the parson credit,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>the devil a soul could find it out,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>I&nbsp;suppose his enemies <span class="show-word">would</span> not, and that his friends could not.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary&rsquo;s licence to set her up,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but the whole secret came out; every horse he had lost, and two horses more than ever he had lost, with all the circumstances of their destruction, were known and distinctly remembered.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>The story ran like wild-fire<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&ldquo;The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized him; and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life; and if it was so, &rsquo;twas plain as the sun at noon-day, he <span class="show-word">would</span> pocket the expence of the licence, ten times told, the very first year:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>So that every body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What were his views in this, and in every other action of his&nbsp;18life,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or rather what were the opinions which </span><span class="c1 c7">floated in the brains of other people</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;concerning it, was a thought which too much floated in his own, and too often broke in <span class="show-word">upon</span> his rest, when he should have been sound asleep.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely easy <span class="show-word">upon</span> that score,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it being just so long since he left his parish,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and the whole world at the same time behind him,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and stands accountable to a Judge of whom he will have no cause to complain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men: Order them as they will, they pass thro&rsquo; a&nbsp;certain medium, which so twists and refracts them from their true directions<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that, with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them are nevertheless forced to live and die without&nbsp;it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful example.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>But to know by what means this came to pass,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and </span><span class="c1 c8">to make that knowledge of use to you,&nbsp;I&nbsp;insist upon it that you read the two following chapters</span><span class="c1">, which contain such a sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along with it.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span></span><span class="c1 c8">When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way,</span><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;we will go on</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with the midwife.</span></p>

<p class="c4 c14"><span class="c1 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was this parson&rsquo;s name, and, what is very remarkable in it (as&nbsp;appears from a most ancient account of the family, wrote <span class="show-word">upon</span> strong vellum, and now in perfect preservation) it had been exactly so spelt for near,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>I&nbsp;was within an ace of saying nine hundred years;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but I <span class="show-word">would</span> not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth, however indisputable in itself;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and therefore I shall content myself with only saying<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>It had been exactly so spelt, without the&nbsp;least variation or transposition of a single letter, for I do not know how long; which is more than I <span class="show-word">would</span> venture to say of<span class="show-word"> one </span>half of the best surnames in the kingdom; which, in a course of years, have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their owners.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>Has this been owing to the pride, or to the shame of the respective proprietors?<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>In honest truth, I&nbsp;think sometimes to the one, and sometimes to the other, just as the temptation has wrought. But a villainous affair it is, and will<span class="show-word"> one </span>day so blend&nbsp;19and confound us altogether, that no<span class="show-word"> one </span>shall be able to stand up and swear, &ldquo;That his own great grand<span class="show-word">father</span> was the man who did either this or that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1 c2">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;family, and their religious preservation of these records I quote, which do farther inform us, That the family was originally of&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Danish</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;extraction, and had been transplanted into&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">England</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as early as in the reign of&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Horwendillus</span><span class="c1">, king of&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Denmark</span><span class="c1">, in whose court, it seems, an ancestor of this Mr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1 c2">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">, and from whom he was lineally descended, held a considerable post to the day of his death. Of what nature this considerable post was, this record saith not;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>It only adds, That, for near two centuries, it had been totally abolished, as altogether unnecessary, not only in that court, but in every other court of the Christian world.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other than that of the king&rsquo;s chief Jester;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and that&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Hamlet&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1">, in our&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Shakespeare</span><span class="c0">, many of whose plays, you know, are founded <span class="show-word">upon</span> authenticated facts, was certainly the very man.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I have not the time to look into&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Saxo-Grammaticus&rsquo;s Danish</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;history, to know the certainty of this;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but if you have leisure, and can easily get at the book, you may do it full as well yourself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had just time, in my travels through&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Denmark</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with Mr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Noddy&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;eldest son, whom, in the year 1741, I&nbsp;accompanied as governor, riding along with him at a prodigious rate thro&rsquo; most parts of&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Europe</span><span class="c1">, and of which original journey performed by us two, </span><span class="c1 c9">a&nbsp;most delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this work</span><span class="c0">; I&nbsp;had just time, I&nbsp;say, and that was all, to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that country;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>namely, &ldquo;That nature was neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but, like a discreet parent, was moderately kind to them all; observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points, pretty near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refined parts; but a great deal of good plain household understanding amongst all ranks of people, of which everybody has a share;&rdquo; which is, I&nbsp;think, very right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">With us, you see, the case is quite different:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span></span><span class="c1 c9">we are all ups and downs in this matter;&mdash;you are a great genius;&mdash;or &rsquo;tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a great dunce and a blockhead;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span></span><span class="c0">not that there is a total want of intermediate steps,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>no,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>we are not so irregular as that comes to;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but the two extremes are&nbsp;more common, and in a greater degree in this unsettled island, where nature, in her gifts and dispositions of this kind, is most whimsical and capricious; fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1 c2">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;extraction, who, by what I can remember of him, and by all the accounts I could ever get of him, seemed not to have had<span class="show-word"> one </span>single drop of&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Danish</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;blood in his whole crasis; in nine hundred years, it might possibly have all run out:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span></span><span class="c1 c9">I&nbsp;will not philosophize one moment with you about it;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for happen how it <span class="show-word">would</span>, the fact was this:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>That instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of sense and humours, you <span class="show-word">would</span> have looked for, in<span class="show-word"> one </span>so extracted;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he was, on the contrary, as mercurial and sublimated a composition,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as heteroclite a creature in all his declensions;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>with as much life and whim, and&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">gait&eacute; de c&oelig;ur</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;about him, as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put together. With all this sail, poor&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;carried not<span class="show-word"> one </span>ounce of ballast; he was utterly unpractised in the world; and, at the age of twenty-six, knew just about as well how to steer his course in it, as a romping, unsuspicious girl of thirteen: So that <span class="show-word">upon</span> his first setting out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine, ran him foul ten times in a day of somebody&rsquo;s tackling; and as the grave and more slow-paced were oftenest in his way,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>you may likewise imagine, &rsquo;twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled. For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Fracas</span><span class="c1">:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>For, to speak the truth,&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to gravity;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>not to gravity as such;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>for where gravity was wanted, he <span class="show-word">would</span> be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks together;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but he was an enemy to the affectation of it, and declared open war against it, only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for folly: and then, whenever it fell in his way, however sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it much quarter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he <span class="show-word">would</span> say that Gravity was an errant scoundrel, and he <span class="show-word">would</span> add,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>of the most dangerous kind too,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>because a sly one; and that he verily believed, more honest, well-meaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in<span class="show-word"> one </span>twelve-month, than by pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered, he <span class="show-word">would</span> say, there was no danger,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but to itself:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>whereas the very essence of gravity was&nbsp;21design, and consequently deceit;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>it was no better, but often worse, than what a&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">French</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;wit had long ago defined it,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span></span><span class="c1 c2">viz.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind</span><span class="c1">;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>which definition of gravity,&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c0">, with great imprudence, <span class="show-word">would</span> say, deserved to be wrote in letters of gold.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;had no impression but one, and that was what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression he <span class="show-word">would</span> usually translate into plain&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">English</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;without any periphrasis;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and too oft without much distinction of either person, time, or place;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an ungenerous proceeding<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he never gave himself a moment&rsquo;s time to reflect who was the hero of the piece,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>what his station,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>or how far he had power to hurt him hereafter;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but if it was a dirty action,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>without more ado,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>The man was a dirty fellow,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and so on.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>And as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">bon mot</span><span class="c1">, or to be enlivened throughout with some drollery or humour of expression, it gave wings to&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1 c2">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;indiscretion. In a word, tho&rsquo; he never sought, yet, at the same time, as he seldom shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost, and without much ceremony;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he had but too many temptations in life, of scattering his wit and his humour,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>his gibes and his jests about him.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>They were not lost for want of gathering.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c9">What were the consequences</span><span class="c1">, and what was&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2 c7">Yorick</span><span class="c1 c2">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;catastrophe there<span class="show-word">upon</span>, </span><span class="c1 c9">you will read in the next chapter.</span></p>

<p class="c4 c14"><span class="c1">My</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;<span class="show-word">father</span>, as anybody may naturally imagine, came down with my <span class="show-word">mother</span> into the country, in but a pettish kind of a humour. The first twenty or five-and-twenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself, and indeed my <span class="show-word">mother</span> too, about the cursed expence, which he said might every shilling of it have been saved;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>then what vexed him more than everything else was, the provoking time of the year,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>which, as I told you, was towards the end of&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">September</span><span class="c1">, when his wall-fruit and green gages especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for pulling:<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&ldquo;Had he been whistled up to&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">London</span><span class="c1">, <span class="show-word">upon</span> a&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Tom Fool&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;errand, in any other month of the whole year</span><span class="c1">, </span><sup>[i]</sup><span class="c1 c7">he should not have said three words about&nbsp;it</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For the next two whole stages, no subject <span class="show-word">would</span> go down, but the heavy blow he had sustain&rsquo;d from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had fully reckon&rsquo;d <span class="show-word">upon</span> in his mind, and register&rsquo;d down in his pocket-book, as a second staff for his old age, in case&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2"><span class="show-word">Bobby</span></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;should fail him. The disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man, than all the money which the journey, etc., had cost him, put together,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>rot the hundred and twenty pounds,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>he did not mind it a rush.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">From&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Stilton</span><span class="c1">, all the way to&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Grantham</span><span class="c1">, nothing in the whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends, and the foolish figure they should both make at church, the first&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Sunday</span><span class="c0">;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>of which, in the satirical vehemence of his wit, now sharpen&rsquo;d a little by vexation, he <span class="show-word">would</span> give so many humorous and provoking descriptions,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and place his rib and&nbsp;33self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole congregation;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that my <span class="show-word">mother</span> declared, these two stages were so truly tragi-comical, that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath, from<span class="show-word"> one </span>end to the other of them all the way.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">From&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Grantham</span><span class="c1">, till they had cross&rsquo;d the&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Trent</span><span class="c1">, my <span class="show-word">father</span> was out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my <span class="show-word">mother</span> had put <span class="show-word">upon</span> him in this affair<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he <span class="show-word">would</span> say to himself, over and over again, &ldquo;the woman could not be deceived herself<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>if she could,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>what weakness!&rdquo;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>tormenting word!<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>which led his imagination a thorny dance, and, before all was over, play&rsquo;d the duce and all with him;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>for sure as ever the word&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">weakness</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was uttered, and struck full <span class="show-word">upon</span> his brain<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>so sure it set him <span class="show-word">upon</span> running divisions <span class="show-word">upon</span> how many kinds of weaknesses there were;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>that there was such a thing as weakness of the body,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as well as weakness of the mind,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and then he <span class="show-word">would</span> do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two together, How far the cause of all these vexations might, or might not, have arisen out of himself.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c9">In short,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;he had so many little subjects of </span><span class="c1 c7">disquietude springing out of</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;this<span class="show-word"> one </span>affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in it, that my <span class="show-word">mother</span>, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy journey of it down.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span></span><span class="c1 c9">In a word,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as she complained to my uncle&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2"><span class="show-word">Toby</span></span><span class="c1">, he <span class="show-word">would</span> have tired out the patience of </span><span class="c1 c7">any flesh</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;alive.</span></p>

her eyes <span class="show-word">upon</span> the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Manningham</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her mind,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five shillings book <span class="show-word">upon</span> the subject of midwifery, in which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the sisterhood itself,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span><span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>but had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the f&oelig;tus in cross births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the world; notwithstanding all this, my <span class="show-word">mother</span>, I&nbsp;say, was absolutely determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul&rsquo;s hand but

as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty shillings a yard,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much trouble;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of tenpence a yard.<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>&rsquo;Tis the duplication of<span class="show-word"> one </span>and the same greatness of soul; only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my <span class="show-word">mother</span>&rsquo;s case, was, that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as<span class="show-word"> one </span>in her&nbsp;35situation might have wished, because the old widwife had really some little claim to be depended <span class="show-word">upon</span>,<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>as much, at least, as success could give her; having, in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the parish, brought

Les Th&eacute;ologiens posent d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute; pour principe, que le bapt&ecirc;me, qui est une naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere naissance; il faut &ecirc;tre n&eacute; dans le monde, pour rena&icirc;tre en&nbsp;</span><span class="c1"><span class="show-word">Jesus</span> Christ</span><span class="c1 c2">, comme ils l&rsquo;enseignent.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">S.&nbsp;Thomas, 3&nbsp;part, qu&aelig;st. 88, artic.

Le concours des th&eacute;ologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les r&eacute;gles des dioc&eacute;ses, paroit former une autorit&eacute; qui termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d&rsquo;un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, que le raisonnement des th&eacute;ologiens est uniquement fond&eacute; sur une raison de convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose que l&rsquo;on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp; d&rsquo;un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, considerant que les m&ecirc;mes th&eacute;ologiens enseignent, que l&rsquo;on peut risquer les sacremens que&nbsp;</span><span class="c1"><span class="show-word">Jesus</span> Christ</span><span class="c1 c2">&nbsp;a &eacute;tablis comme des moyens faciles, mais n&eacute;cessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; &amp; d&rsquo;ailleurs estimant, que les enfans renferm&eacute;s dans le sein de leurs meres, pourroient &ecirc;tre capables de salut, parcequ&rsquo;ils sont capables de damnation;<span class="show-word">&mdash;</span>pour ces considerations, &amp; en egard &agrave; l&rsquo;expos&eacute;, suivant lequel on&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">46</span><span class="c1 c13 c2">assure avoir trouv&eacute; un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renferm&eacute;s, sans faire aucun tort &agrave; la mere, le Conseil estime que l&rsquo;on pourroit se servir du moyen propos&eacute;, dans la confiance qu&rsquo;il a, que Dieu n&rsquo;a point laiss&eacute; ces sortes d&rsquo;enfans sans aucuns secours, &amp; supposant, comme il est expos&eacute;, que le moyen dont il s&rsquo;agit est propre &agrave; leur procurer le bapt&ecirc;me; cependant comme il s&rsquo;agiroit, en autorisant la pratique propos&eacute;e, de changer une regie universellement &eacute;tablie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; &agrave; qui il appartient de juger de l&rsquo;utilit&eacute;, &amp; du danger du moyen propos&eacute;, &amp; comme, sous le bon plaisir de l&rsquo;ev&ecirc;que, le Conseil estime qu&rsquo;il faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d&rsquo;expliquer les r&eacute;gles de l&rsquo;eglise, &amp; d&rsquo;y d&eacute;roger dans le cas, ou la loi ne s&ccedil;auroit obliger, quelque sage &amp; quelque utile que paroisse la mani&eacute;re de baptiser dont il s&rsquo;agit, le Conseil ne pourroit l&rsquo;approuver sans le concours de ces deux autorit&eacute;s. On conseile au moins &agrave; celui qui consulte, de s&rsquo;addresser &agrave; son ev&ecirc;que, &amp; de lui faire part de la presente d&eacute;cision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussign&eacute;s s&rsquo;appuyent, il puisse &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute; dans le cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, ou il risqueroit trop d&rsquo;attendre que la permission f&ucirc;t demand&eacute;e &amp; accord&eacute;e d&rsquo;employer le moyen qu&rsquo;il propose si avantageux au salut de l&rsquo;enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que l&rsquo;on pourroit s&rsquo;en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il s&rsquo;agit, venoient au monde, contre l&rsquo;esperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du m&ecirc;me moyen, il seroit n&eacute;cessaire de les baptiser sous condition; &amp; en cela le Conseil se conforme &agrave; tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le bapt&ecirc;me d&rsquo;un enfant qui fait paro&icirc;tre quelque partie de son corps, enjoignent n&eacute;antmoins, &amp; ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition, s&rsquo;il vient heureusement au monde.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Deliber&eacute; en&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Sorbonne</span><span class="c1">, le 10&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Avril</span><span class="c0">, 1733.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">A.
